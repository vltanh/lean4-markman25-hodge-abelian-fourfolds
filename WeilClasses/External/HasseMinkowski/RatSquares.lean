# Rational square classes via `p`-adic valuations

Layer 1 of the Hasse–Minkowski development. A rational number `q` is a square in `ℚ`
if and only if `q` is nonnegative and every one of its `p`-adic valuations is even.

The proof reduces `q = q.num / q.den` to the corresponding statement for naturals: an
integer (resp. natural) is a square exactly when all exponents in its prime
factorization are even. Since `q.num` and `q.den` are coprime, at most one of them is
divisible by any given prime, so the evenness of the difference
`padicValRat p q = (q.num).factorization p - (q.den).factorization p`
forces the two exponents to be even individually.

/-! ### Rational squares via `p`-adic valuations

Since `q.num` and `q.den` are coprime, at most one of them is divisible by a given
prime `p`, so only one of the two exponents in `padicValRat p q` is nonzero. Evenness
of the difference therefore forces evenness of each exponent separately, which by
`isSquare_nat_iff_even_factorization` makes both `q.num` and `q.den` squares. -/
