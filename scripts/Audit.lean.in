# Axiom and dependency audit

Run with `lake env lean scripts/Audit.lean` after `lake build`.

For every numbered result of the paper, this prints the axioms it depends on and the results from
prior work (`PaperName/External/`) that it uses, whether proved there or, in a conditional
formalization, assumed as hypotheses of its statement. It then checks every declaration
of the library and the theorems that Palomar's comparator checks. The run fails if any of them
depends on an axiom other than Lean's standard `propext`, `Classical.choice` and `Quot.sound` (a
`sorry` shows up as the axiom `sorryAx`). Its table of results is the source of the report's
dependency table.

It also writes the *route* of every numbered result to `.lake/route_deps.tsv`: the other
numbered results that its proof uses, found by following the proof through the library's helper
lemmas and stopping at numbered results, together with the TeX label that the result's docstring
names in backticks. `route_check.py` (in the skill's `scripts/`) compares these routes with the
results that the paper's proofs cite.

The library's modules are imported with `import all`, which makes the proofs of their theorems
available: the module system does not export them otherwise. The traversal tests membership in a
precomputed set of the library's constants; looking up each constant's module instead
(`Environment.getModuleIdxFor?`) makes the interpreted script take minutes.

To adapt: generate the `import all` lines, fill in the three lists, and set the library's root
name in `isLibraryModule`. Keep one `import all` line per module of the library, each on its own
line: a module that is missing is still imported through the others, but without its proofs, and
the audit then misses the axioms and the routes inside them. The CI template checks the list.
